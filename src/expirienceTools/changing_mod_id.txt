----------- How to Change the 'modid' -----------

1. Go into gradle.properties and change the properties 'maven_group' and 'archives_base_name' accordingly.
These do not necessarily need to be synced.

2. Run Gradle -> mod-folder-name -> Tasks -> build -> build (Configuration)

2. Go into src/main/java/com/[mod id]/ExampleMod and change the 'MOD_ID' variable to your mod ID.

3. Go to src/main/java/resources/fabric.mod.json and change the appearences of your old mod ID to your new mod ID.
In this file, you are also going to change any appearences of 'archives_base_name' to the new one. Example:

    "entrypoints": {
        "main": [
        			"com.example.ExampleMod" <------
        		],
        		"client": [
        			"com.example.ExampleModClient" <-----
        		]
        	}
    }

(Every occurence for com._____ should be underlined red after building, because path would be outdated.)

4. Rename every file in src/main and src/client that has your old modid in the name, because it is unlikely this
will happen for you.

5. Lastly, run the build configuration that we previously ran just to be safe.
